# movieplanet

 movie planet is a Javascript axios framework , HTML and ImDB Api to search a movie for tile, name, author,direcor, year..
 to run the project you need to install leve-server (sudo npm install g- live-server) and with the cmd live-server your are good to go. you do not need to install the axios since I used the CDN link.
